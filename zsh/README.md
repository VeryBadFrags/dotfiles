## 🛠️ Framework

- <https://ohmyz.sh>
- <https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit>
- <https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto>

After trying many plugin managers, Zinit felt the best in terms of customization and feature set.
Omz is definitely bloated, but has my favorite "batteries included" config.

## 💅 Themes
